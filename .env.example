# URL of the backend API service, without a trailing slash.
# Used by nginx to proxy /api/* requests.
# When the backend runs in the same Docker Compose project, use
# the Compose service name, e.g.:
#   BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8000
# For an external backend, use the full URL, e.g.:
#   BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com
BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8000

# Host port to expose the frontend on (default: 80).
# Change this to run the frontend on a different port, e.g.:
#   FRONTEND_PORT=5555
FRONTEND_PORT=80

# Host port to expose HTTPS on (default: 443).
# Only active when SSL_CERT and SSL_KEY are also set.
FRONTEND_HTTPS_PORT=443

# Absolute paths *inside the container* to the SSL certificate and private key.
# Required only for HTTPS support.
# Mount the directory containing these files via the volumes section in
# docker-compose.yml, e.g.:
#   volumes:
#     - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl:ro
# SSL_CERT=/etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem
# SSL_KEY=/etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem
